# Simon-Game

This is a digital Simon Says game created using a combination of HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery.

By pressing any keyboard key you can begin the Simon Says game. The game will highlight a coloured button on each level that the user needs to press and remember, this will also play the corresponding sound for the button that was pressed. The user is expected to memorise the pattern of highlighted buttons, and as they go up the levels, they need to press the buttons in the correct order to successful reach the next level. If the incorrect button is clicked on any level, the game ends and the user is asked to restart the game.

This game detects keyboard clicks on the coloured buttons, as well as keyboard presses to start/restart the game. The game will also play a different sound that is set for each button any time they are pressed. It will also play a sound for when the user fails to press the correct pattern and the game ends.
